RISE
==================
## What this project does
This web application focuses on support for women's mental and physical health and provides information and resources on common conditions, and utilizes resources to improve self-care in a safe and educational environment.

## Why this project is useful
This project helps enhance people's understanding of womenâ€™s unique health needs and empower women to be more engaged in health care decisions. This project aims to challange the reality that women are more likely to face specific mental and health issues but have a lack of information and resources to find assistance and improve their lives.

## How we built this 
The web page was created using Qoom and written in HTML and CSS. In accordance with the "Best Practices for UI/UX" etablished by Usability.gov, the leading resource for UX best practices and guidelines in government and private sector, the web site focused on simplicity, clarity, accessibility, consistency of UI elements and purposeful page layout. I used contrasting colours to seperate different key concepts and features such as "hover to zoom" on information-dense images to direct attention to the most relevant information to the user as they navigated the page and "open in new tab"to open up selected options such as Google Maps and YouTube Videos to access resources in a more accessible way. Furthermore, I included links that would provide relevant locations where the user could access resources like counselling and therapy.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of 
Although I have some programming skills I definitely pushed myself for this Hack The Gap hackathon. I entered it alone with the goal of pushing myself to mostly improve my front-end developing and to experiment different ideas.

## What is next for this project
This project has 2 main ideas to improve it for future use. The first idea is to broaden the resources and information provided. I would not only like to have data that can be accessed and is relevant to users from different countries. Furthermore, this will allow for user's of different county's to have resources and information catered to their need. The second idea is to create a log in page that allows the user to save their journal entries on the website. This will allow for the user to feel like like the journal is more of a private diary that is secure from others. Additionally, this would allow for user's to view their previous entries and make decisions based on their own thought process.
